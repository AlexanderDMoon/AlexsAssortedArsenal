Ancient's Arsenal, formerly Alex's Assorted Arsenal. Thank you all for your support, and for helping make this mod possible!

A mod created by me to augment your gameplay with weapons and accessories spanning across the game's progression. Mod Icon made by Cherry.

The mod currently adds tons of new weapons and ammo, along with new accessories, potions, crafting materials, and enemies; All of that, with much more to come!

This is my very first mod! It's been quite a learning experience for me, and I've learned a lot so far! I've gotten better at coding and spriting thanks to this mod, and thanks to everyone that's helped me build it from the ground up.
